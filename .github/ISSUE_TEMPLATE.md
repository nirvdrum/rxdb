  # STOP: DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE!

  It is very unlikely that you want to create an issue.

  ## You have found a bug?
  -> Create a pull request where you tried to reproduce the problem or at least have shown that you tried to do so.
     You can start by using the bug-report template: https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/test/unit/bug-report.test.ts
     Also read the bug checklist here: https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/orga/bug-checklist.md

  ## You have a feature request?
  -> Create a pull request that shows how the RxDB API would change or how the new feature could be used.

  ## You have a common question which cannot be solved with a PR
  -> Ask it at one of these places:
    - Chat: https://discord.gg/tqt9ZttJfD
    - Github discussions: https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/discussions
    - Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rxdb

  ## Everything else will likely be autoclosed. The maintainers time is as same as valuable as yours. 
  You are also a developer! You can fix stuff by yourself.
